Just a new tab page I created for myself.
The UI is very simple and minimal because it is intended to be a high speed middle man to accelrate searching and browser usage. It is not meant to hold attention.


To use github token change thread_sample.js to thread.js
and add your token in access_token=YOUR_TOKEN

It is recommended to git track logs, for backup.
